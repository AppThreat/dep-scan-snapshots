This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`.   This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.   ### Patches  3.2.2 || 4.4.14 || 5.0.6 || 6.1.1  NOTE: an adjacent issue [CVE 2021 32803 (https://github.com/npm/node tar/security/advisories/GHSA r628 mhmh qjhw) affects this release level. Please ensure you update to the latest patch levels that address CVE 2021 32803 as well if this adjacent issue affects your `node tar` use case.  ### Workarounds  Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.  ```js const path = require('path') const tar = require('tar')  tar.x({  file: 'archive.tgz',  // either add this function...  onentry: (entry) => {   if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {    entry.path = sanitizeAbsolutePathSomehow(entry.path)    entry.absolute = path.resolve(entry.path)   }  },   // or this one  filter: (file, entry) => {   if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {    return false   } else {    return true   }  } }) ```  Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patch versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.

If this fetch fails, fsevents v1.x will attempt to build this artifact directly from source.  Version 1.x of fsevents has been deprecated for several years and as a result the aforementioned cloud storage resource namespace was available for registration. A third party, unrelated to the fsevents maintainers, subsequently claimed this namespace and in April 2023 this third party started serving modified versions of the \u201cfse.node\u201d binary executable artifact to new fsevents v1.x users.   As of April 27, 2023 the cloud storage resource in question has been indefinitely suspended and is no longer serving binaries.  The affected cloud storage pre fetch was [removed (https://github.com/fsevents/fsevents/commit/909af26846834642c81d19f4148afa3b7557b058) in fsevents version 1.2.11.  ## Impact  The impact of the modified versions of fse.node appears to be limited to information gathering.   Note that initial analysis was performed for the modified artifact associated with fsevents v1.2.9, which was distributed as fse v1.2.9 node v72 darwin x64.tar.gz prior to the cloud storage resource being suspended.   For more detailed analysis you may compare a decompilation of the v1.x fse.node artifacts on your systems with the intended fsevents v1.x source as it exists at https://github.com/fsevents/fsevents/tree/v1.x   ## How to fix it  If you are dependent on the deprecated version of fsevents v1.x, the recommended course of action is to upgrade to fsevents v2.x or remove the dependency altogether as currently maintained versions of Node.js no longer require fsevents for file system watching on macOS.

I haven't seen legitimate cases of date time strings longer than that, so all moment users who do pass a user originating string to constructor are encouraged to apply such a rudimentary filter, that would help with this but also most future ReDoS vulnerabilities.  ### References There is an excellent writeup of the issue here: https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/6015#issuecomment 1152961973=  ### Details The issue is rooted in the code that removes legacy comments (stuff inside parenthesis) from strings during rfc2822 parsing. `moment(\"(\".repeat(500000))` will take a few minutes to process, which is unacceptable.

This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory.  This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D: extraction dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory.  Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path.  This only affects users of `node tar` on Windows systems.  ### Patches  4.4.18 || 5.0.10 || 6.1.9  ### Workarounds  There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node tar now does.  Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.  ### Fix  The fixed versions strip path roots from all paths prior to being resolved against the extraction target folder, even if such paths are not \"absolute\".  Additionally, a path starting with a drive letter and then two dots, like `c:../`, would bypass the check for `..` path portions. This is checked properly in the patched versions.  Finally, a defense in depth check is added, such that if the `entry.absolute` is outside of the extraction taret, and we are not in preservePaths:true mode, a warning is raised on that entry, and it is skipped. Currently, it is believed that this check is redundant, but it did catch some oversights in development.

When a user of Express performs a redirect using a user provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl` (https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.  The main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.  ### Patches  https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94  An initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.  ### Workarounds  The fix for this involves pre parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.  ### References  https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539 https://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800 https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location Upgrade to version 4.19.2 or later"},{"category":"other","text":"Update to version 4.19.2 to resolve CVE-2024-29041 or update to version 4.20.0 to resolve additional vulnerabilities for this package.","title":"Recommended Action"}],"product_status":{"known_affected":["express@<4.19.2","express@vers:npm/>=0.0.0|<4.19.2"],"known_not_affected":["express@4.19.2"]},"references":[{"summary":"Expressjs Advisory api","url":"https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location"},{"summary":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc","url":"https://github.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc"},{"summary":"CVE Record CVE-2024-29041","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29041"}],"scores":[{"cvss_v3":{"attackComplexity":"LOW","attackVector":"NETWORK","availabilityImpact":"NONE","baseScore":6.1,"baseSeverity":"MEDIUM","confidentialityImpact":"LOW","environmentalScore":6.1,"environmentalSeverity":"MEDIUM","integrityImpact":"LOW","modifiedAttackComplexity":"LOW","modifiedAttackVector":"NETWORK","modifiedAvailabilityImpact":"NONE","modifiedConfidentialityImpact":"LOW","modifiedIntegrityImpact":"LOW","modifiedPrivilegesRequired":"NONE","modifiedScope":"CHANGED","modifiedUserInteraction":"REQUIRED","privilegesRequired":"NONE","scope":"CHANGED","temporalScore":6.1,"temporalSeverity":"MEDIUM","userInteraction":"REQUIRED","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","version":"3.1"},"products":["express@<4.19.2","express@vers:npm/>=0.0.0|<4.19.2"]}],"title":"CVE-2024-29041/pkg:npm/express@4.16.4"},{"acknowledgements":[{"organization":"NVD","urls":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45133"]}],"cve":"CVE-2023-45133","cwe":{"id":"184","name":"Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs"},"discovery_date":"2023-10-16T13:55:36","ids":[{"system_name":"CVE Record","text":"CVE-2023-45133"},{"system_name":"GitHub Advisory","text":"GHSA-67hx-6x53-jw92"},{"system_name":"Debian Advisory","text":"dsa-5528"}],"notes":[{"audience":"developers","category":"other","text":"Incorrect Comparison","title":"Additional CWE: 697"},{"category":"description","details":"Vulnerability Description","text":"Babel vulnerable to arbitrary code execution when compiling specifically crafted malicious code ### Impact  Using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path"},{"category":"details","details":"Vulnerability Details","text":"# Babel vulnerable to arbitrary code execution when compiling specifically crafted malicious code ### Impact  Using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods.

Babel 6 does not receive security fixes anymore (see [Babel's security policy (https://github.com/babel/babel/security/policy)), hence there is no patch planned for `babel traverse@6`.  ### Workarounds   Upgrade `@babel/traverse` to v7.23.2 or higher. You can do this by deleting it from your package manager's lockfile and re installing the dependencies. `@babel/core` >=7.23.2 will automatically pull in a non vulnerable version.

Description:  During some analysis today on npm's `node tar` package I came across the folder creation process, Basicly if you provide node tar with a path like this `./a/b/c/foo.txt` it would create every folder and sub folder here a, b and c until it reaches the last folder to create `foo.txt`, In this case I noticed that there's no validation at all on the amount of folders being created, that said we're actually able to CPU and memory consume the system running node tar and even crash the nodejs client within few seconds of running it using a path with too many sub folders inside  ## Steps To Reproduce: You can reproduce this issue by downloading the tar file I provided in the resources and using node tar to extract it, you should get the same behavior as the video  ## Proof Of Concept:

For example, `/:a :b`.  ### Patches  For users of 0.1, upgrade to `0.1.10`. All other users should upgrade to `8.0.0`.  These versions add backtrack protection when a custom regex pattern is not provided:   [0.1.10 (https://github.com/pillarjs/path to regexp/releases/tag/v0.1.10)  [1.9.0 (https://github.com/pillarjs/path to regexp/releases/tag/v1.9.0)  [3.3.0 (https://github.com/pillarjs/path to regexp/releases/tag/v3.3.0)  [6.3.0 (https://github.com/pillarjs/path to regexp/releases/tag/v6.3.0)  They do not protect against vulnerable user supplied capture groups. Protecting against explicit user patterns is out of scope for old versions and not considered a vulnerability.  Version [7.1.0 (https://github.com/pillarjs/path to regexp/releases/tag/v7.1.0) can enable `strict: true` and get an error when the regular expression might be bad.  Version [8.0.0 (https://github.com/pillarjs/path to regexp/releases/tag/v8.0.0) removes the features that can cause a ReDoS.  ### Workarounds  All versions can be patched by providing a custom regular expression for parameters after the first in a single segment. As long as the custom regular expression does not match the text before the parameter, you will be safe. For example, change `/:a :b` to `/:a :b([ / +)`.  If paths cannot be rewritten and versions cannot be upgraded, another alternative is to limit the URL length. For example, halving the attack string improves performance by 4x faster.  ### Details  Using `/:a :b` will produce the regular expression `/ /([ / +?) ([ / +?) /?$/`. This can be exploited by a path such as `/a${' a'.repeat(8_000)}/a`. [OWASP (https://owasp.org/www community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_ _ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but the TL;DR is the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a :b` on the repeated 8,000 ` a`.  Because JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.  ### References  * [OWASP (https://owasp.org/www community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_ _ReDoS) * [Detailed blog post (https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024 09 web redos/) Upgrade to version 0.1.10 or later"},{"category":"other","text":"Update to version 0.1.10.","title":"Recommended Action"}],"product_status":{"known_affected":["path-to-regexp@<0.1.10","path-to-regexp@vers:npm/>=0.0.0|<0.1.10"],"known_not_affected":["path-to-regexp@0.1.10"]},"references":[{"summary":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j","url":"https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/security/advisories/GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j"},{"summary":"CVE Record CVE-2024-45296","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45296"}],"scores":[{"cvss_v3":{"attackComplexity":"LOW","attackVector":"NETWORK","availabilityImpact":"HIGH","baseScore":7.5,"baseSeverity":"HIGH","confidentialityImpact":"NONE","environmentalScore":7.5,"environmentalSeverity":"HIGH","integrityImpact":"NONE","modifiedAttackComplexity":"LOW","modifiedAttackVector":"NETWORK","modifiedAvailabilityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedConfidentialityImpact":"NONE","modifiedIntegrityImpact":"NONE","modifiedPrivilegesRequired":"NONE","modifiedScope":"UNCHANGED","modifiedUserInteraction":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","temporalScore":7.5,"temporalSeverity":"HIGH","userInteraction":"NONE","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","version":"3.1"},"products":["path-to-regexp@<0.1.10","path-to-regexp@vers:npm/>=0.0.0|<0.1.10"]}],"title":"CVE-2024-45296/pkg:npm/path-to-regexp@0.1.7"},{"acknowledgements":[{"organization":"NVD","urls":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47764"]}],"cve":"CVE-2024-47764","cwe":{"id":"74","name":"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component"},"discovery_date":"2024-10-04T20:31:00","notes":[{"category":"description","details":"Vulnerability Description","text":"cookie accepts cookie name, path, and domain with out of bounds characters ### Impact  The cookie name could be used to set other fields of the cookie, resulting in an unexpected cookie value"},{"category":"details","details":"Vulnerability Details","text":"# cookie accepts cookie name, path, and domain with out of bounds characters ### Impact  The cookie name could be used to set other fields of the cookie, resulting in an unexpected cookie value.

If this fetch fails, fsevents v1.x will attempt to build this artifact directly from source.  Version 1.x of fsevents has been deprecated for several years and as a result the aforementioned cloud storage resource namespace was available for registration. A third party, unrelated to the fsevents maintainers, subsequently claimed this namespace and in April 2023 this third party started serving modified versions of the \u201cfse.node\u201d binary executable artifact to new fsevents v1.x users.   As of April 27, 2023 the cloud storage resource in question has been indefinitely suspended and is no longer serving binaries.  The affected cloud storage pre-fetch was [removed](https://github.com/fsevents/fsevents/commit/909af26846834642c81d19f4148afa3b7557b058) in fsevents version 1.2.11.  ## Impact  The impact of the modified versions of fse.node appears to be limited to information gathering.   Note that initial analysis was performed for the modified artifact associated with fsevents v1.2.9, which was distributed as fse-v1.2.9-node-v72-darwin-x64.tar.gz prior to the cloud storage resource being suspended.   For more detailed analysis you may compare a decompilation of the v1.x fse.node artifacts on your systems with the intended fsevents v1.x source as it exists at https://github.com/fsevents/fsevents/tree/v1.x   ## How to fix it  If you are dependent on the deprecated version of fsevents v1.x, the recommended course of action is to upgrade to fsevents v2.x or remove the dependency altogether as currently maintained versions of Node.js no longer require fsevents for file system watching on macOS."},{"category":"other","text":"Update to version 1.2.11.","title":"Recommended Action"}],"product_status":{"known_affected":["fsevents@vers:npm/>=1.0.0|<1.2.11"],"known_not_affected":["fsevents@1.2.11"]},"references":[{"summary":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-xv2f-5jw4-v95m","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xv2f-5jw4-v95m"},{"summary":"NPM Advisory fsevents","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/fsevents"},{"summary":"NPM Advisory NPM-fsevents","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/fsevents"}],"scores":[{"cvss_v3":{"attackComplexity":"LOW","attackVector":"NETWORK","availabilityImpact":"HIGH","baseScore":9.8,"baseSeverity":"CRITICAL","confidentialityImpact":"HIGH","environmentalScore":9.8,"environmentalSeverity":"CRITICAL","integrityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedAttackComplexity":"LOW","modifiedAttackVector":"NETWORK","modifiedAvailabilityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedConfidentialityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedIntegrityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedPrivilegesRequired":"NONE","modifiedScope":"UNCHANGED","modifiedUserInteraction":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","temporalScore":9.8,"temporalSeverity":"CRITICAL","userInteraction":"NONE","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","version":"3.1"},"products":["fsevents@vers:npm/>=1.0.0|<1.2.11"]}],"title":"MAL-2023-462/pkg:npm/fsevents@1.2.9"},{"acknowledgements":[{"organization":"NVD","urls":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7598"]}],"cve":"CVE-2020-7598","cwe":{"id":"1321","name":"Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes"},"discovery_date":"2020-04-03T21:48:32","ids":[{"system_name":"NPM Advisory","text":"1179"},{"system_name":"CVE Record","text":"CVE-2020-7598"},{"system_name":"NPM Advisory","text":"NPM-1179"},{"system_name":"Snyk Advisory","text":"SNYK-JS-MINIMIST-559764"}],"notes":[{"category":"description","details":"Vulnerability Description","text":"Prototype Pollution in minimist"},{"category":"details","details":"Vulnerability Details","text":"# Prototype Pollution in minimist Affected versions of `minimist` are vulnerable to prototype pollution.

path sanitization ### Impact  Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution  `node-tar` aims to prevent extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to `true`. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`.   This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.   ### Patches  3.2.2 || 4.4.14 || 5.0.6 || 6.1.1  NOTE: an adjacent issue [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw) affects this release level. Please ensure you update to the latest patch levels that address CVE-2021-32803 as well if this adjacent issue affects your `node-tar` use case.  ### Workarounds  Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.  ```js const path = require('path') const tar = require('tar')  tar.x({  file: 'archive.tgz',  // either add this function...  onentry: (entry) => {   if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {    entry.path = sanitizeAbsolutePathSomehow(entry.path)    entry.absolute = path.resolve(entry.path)   }  },   // or this one  filter: (file, entry) => {   if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {    return false   } else {    return true   }  } }) ```  Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patch versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves."},{"category":"other","text":"Update to version 4.4.14 to resolve CVE-2021-32804 or update to version 6.2.1 to resolve additional vulnerabilities for this package.","title":"Recommended Action"}],"product_status":{"known_affected":["tar@vers:npm/>=4.0.0|<4.4.14"],"known_not_affected":["tar@4.4.14"]},"references":[{"summary":"Siemens Advisory ssa-389290","url":"https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf"},{"summary":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9","url":"https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9"},{"summary":"CVE Record CVE-2021-32804","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32804"},{"summary":"NPM Advisory NPM-1770","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1770"},{"summary":"NPM Advisory 1770","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1770"},{"summary":"NPM Advisory NPM-tar","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar"},{"summary":"NPM Advisory tar","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar"},{"summary":"Oracle Advisory cpuoct2021","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"}],"scores":[{"cvss_v3":{"attackComplexity":"LOW","attackVector":"LOCAL","availabilityImpact":"NONE","baseScore":8.2,"baseSeverity":"HIGH","confidentialityImpact":"HIGH","environmentalScore":8.2,"environmentalSeverity":"HIGH","integrityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedAttackComplexity":"LOW","modifiedAttackVector":"LOCAL","modifiedAvailabilityImpact":"NONE","modifiedConfidentialityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedIntegrityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedPrivilegesRequired":"NONE","modifiedScope":"CHANGED","modifiedUserInteraction":"REQUIRED","privilegesRequired":"NONE","scope":"CHANGED","temporalScore":8.2,"temporalSeverity":"HIGH","userInteraction":"REQUIRED","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N","version":"3.1"},"products":["tar@vers:npm/>=4.0.0|<4.4.14"]}],"title":"CVE-2021-32804/pkg:npm/tar@4.4.8"},{"acknowledgements":[{"organization":"NVD","urls":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37713"]}],"cve":"CVE-2021-37713","cwe":{"id":"22","name":"Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory"},"discovery_date":"2021-08-31T16:05:05","ids":[{"system_name":"CVE Record","text":"CVE-2021-37713"},{"system_name":"GitHub Advisory","text":"GHSA-5955-9wpr-37jh"},{"system_name":"Oracle Advisory","text":"cpuoct2021"},{"system_name":"Siemens Advisory","text":"ssa-389290"}],"notes":[{"category":"description","details":"Vulnerability Description","text":"Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite on Windows via insufficient relative path sanitization"},{"category":"details","details":"Vulnerability Details","text":"# Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite on Windows via insufficient relative path sanitization ### Impact  Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution  node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory.  This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory.  Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path.  This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems.  ### Patches  4.4.18 || 5.0.10 || 6.1.9  ### Workarounds  There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does.  Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.  ### Fix  The fixed versions strip path roots from all paths prior to being resolved against the extraction target folder, even if such paths are not \"absolute\".  Additionally, a path starting with a drive letter and then two dots, like `c:../`, would bypass the check for `..` path portions. This is checked properly in the patched versions.  Finally, a defense in depth check is added, such that if the `entry.absolute` is outside of the extraction taret, and we are not in preservePaths:true mode, a warning is raised on that entry, and it is skipped.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.  This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both ` and `/` characters as path separators, however ` is a valid filename character on posix systems.  By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.  Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created.   These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7.  The v3 branch of `node-tar` has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of `node-tar`. If this is not possible, a workaround is available below.  ### Patches  4.4.16 || 5.0.8 || 6.1.7  ### Workarounds  Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom filter method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.  ```js const tar = require('tar')  tar.x({  file: 'archive.tgz',  filter: (file, entry) => {   if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink') {    return false   } else {    return true   }  } }) ```  Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.  ### Fix  The problem is addressed in the following ways:  1. All paths are normalized to use `/` as a path separator, replacing ` with `/` on Windows systems, and leaving ` intact in the path on posix systems. This is performed in depth, at every level of the program where paths are consumed. 2. Directory cache pruning is performed case-insensitively. This _may_ result in undue cache misses on case-sensitive file systems, but the performance impact is negligible.  #### Caveat  Note that this means that the `entry` objects exposed in various parts of tar's API will now always use `/` as a path separator, even on Windows systems. This is not expected to cause problems, as `/` is a valid path separator on Windows systems, but _may_ result in issues if `entry.path` is compared against a path string coming from some other API such as `fs.realpath()` or `path.resolve()`.  Users are encouraged to always normalize paths using a well-tested method such as `path.resolve()` before comparing paths to one another."},{"category":"other","text":"Update to version 4.4.16 to

### Impact Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution  node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.  This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained two directories and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 \"short path\" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include directories with two forms of the path that resolve to the same file system entity, followed by a symbolic link with a name in the first form, lastly followed by a file using the second form. It led to bypassing node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.

The `String.normalize('NFKD')` method is used to first normalize all unicode to its maximally compatible and multi-code-point form. 2. All slashes are normalized to `/` on Windows systems (on posix systems, ` is a valid filename character, and thus left intact). 3. When a symbolic link is encountered on Windows systems, the entire directory cache is cleared.
