The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.  These are the prerequisites for the exploit: - JDK 9 or higher - Apache Tomcat as the Servlet container - Packaged as WAR - `spring-webmvc` or `spring-webflux` dependency  ## Patches  - Spring Framework [5.3.18](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.3.18) and [5.2.20](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.2.20.RELEASE) - Spring Boot [2.6.6](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.6.6) and [2.5.12](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.5.12)  ## Workarounds  For those who are unable to upgrade, leaked reports recommend setting `disallowedFields` on `WebDataBinder` through an `@ControllerAdvice`. This works generally, but as a centrally applied workaround fix, may leave some loopholes, in particular if a controller sets `disallowedFields` locally through its own `@InitBinder` method, which overrides the global setting.  To apply the workaround in a more fail-safe way, applications could extend `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` to update the `WebDataBinder` at the end after all other initialization. In order to do that, a Spring Boot application can declare a `WebMvcRegistrations` bean (Spring MVC) or a `WebFluxRegistrations` bean (Spring WebFlux)."}],"product_status":{"known_affected":["org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-web@vers:maven/>=1.0.0.RELEASE|<=2.5.9"]},"references":[{"summary":"Packetstormsecurity Exploit","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166713/Spring4Shell-Code-Execution.html"},{"summary":"Packetstormsecurity Exploit","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167011/Spring4Shell-Spring-Framework-Class-Property-Remote-Code-Execution.html"},{"summary":"Siemens Advisory ssa-254054","url":"https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-254054.pdf"},{"summary":"CVE Record","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22965"},{"summary":"Cve 2022","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22965"},{"summary":"Sonicwall Advisory SNWLID-2022-0005","url":"https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0005"},{"summary":"Vmware Advisory cve-2022-22965","url":"https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-22965"},{"summary":"Cisco Advisory cisco-sa-java-spring-rce-Zx9GUc67","url":"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-java-spring-rce-Zx9GUc67"},{"summary":"Oracle Advisory cpuapr2022","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"},{"summary":"Oracle Advisory cpujul2022","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"}],"scores":[{"cvss_v3":{"attackComplexity":"LOW","attackVector":"NETWORK","availabilityImpact":"HIGH","baseScore":9.8,"baseSeverity":"CRITICAL","confidentialityImpact":"HIGH","environmentalScore":9.8,"environmentalSeverity":"CRITICAL","integrityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedAttackComplexity":"LOW","modifiedAttackVector":"NETWORK","modifiedAvailabilityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedConfidentialityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedIntegrityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedPrivilegesRequired":"NONE","modifiedScope":"UNCHANGED","modifiedUserInteraction":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","temporalScore":9.8,"temporalSeverity":"CRITICAL","userInteraction":"NONE","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","version":"3.1"},"products":["org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-web@vers:maven/>=1.0.0.RELEASE|<=2.5.9"]}],"title":"CVE-2022-22965/pkg:maven/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-web@1.5.1.RELEASE?type=jar"},{"acknowledgements":[{"organization":"NVD","urls":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-27772"]}],"cve":"CVE-2022-27772","cwe":{"id":"377","name":"Insecure Temporary File"},"discovery_date":"2022-07-11T20:59:02","ids":[{"system_name":"CVE Record","text":"CVE-2022-27772"},{"system_name":"GitHub Advisory","text":"GHSA-cm59-pr5q-cw85"}],"notes":[{"audience":"developers","category":"other","text":"Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions","title":"Additional CWE: 379"},{"audience":"developers","category":"other","text":"Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere","title":"Additional CWE: 668"},{"category":"description","details":"Vulnerability Description","text":"Temporary Directory Hijacking to Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in org.springframework.boot:spring-boot"},{"category":"details","details":"Vulnerability Details","text":"# Temporary Directory Hijacking to Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in org.springframework.boot:spring-boot spring-boot versions prior to version `v2.2.11.RELEASE` was vulnerable to temporary directory hijacking. This vulnerability impacted the `org.springframework.boot.web.server.AbstractConfigurableWebServerFactory.createTempDir` method.  The vulnerable method is used to create a work directory for embedded web servers such as Tomcat and Jetty. The directory contains configuration files, JSP/class files, etc. If a local attacker got the permission to write in this directory, they could completely take over the application (ie. local privilege escalation).  #### Impact Location  This vulnerability impacted the following source location:  ```java  /**   * Return the absolute temp dir for given web server.   * @param prefix server name   * @return the temp dir for given server.   */  protected final File createTempDir(String prefix) {   try {    File tempDir = File.createTempFile(prefix + \".\", \".\" + getPort());    tempDir.delete();    tempDir.mkdir();    tempDir.deleteOnExit();    return tempDir;   } ``` \\- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/ce70e7d768977242a8ea6f93188388f273be5851/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/web/server/AbstractConfigurableWebServerFactory.java#L165-L177  This vulnerability exists because `File.mkdir` returns `false` when it fails to create a directory, it does not throw an exception. As such, the following race condition exists:  ```java File tmpDir =File.createTempFile(prefix + \".\", \".\" + getPort()); // Attacker knows the full path of the file that will be generated // delete the file that was created tmpDir.delete(); // Attacker sees file is deleted and begins a race to create their own directory before Jetty. // and make a directory of the same name // SECURITY VULNERABILITY: Race Condition! - Attacker beats java code and now owns this directory tmpDir.mkdirs(); // This method returns 'false' because it was unable to create the directory. No exception is thrown. // Attacker can write any new files to this directory that they wish. // Attacker can read any files created by this process. ```  ### Prerequisites  This vulnerability impacts Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users.  ### Patches  This vulnerability was inadvertently fixed as a part of this patch: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/commit/667ccdae84822072f9ea1a27ed5c77964c71002d  This vulnerability is patched in versions `v2.2.11.RELEASE` or later.  ### Workarounds  Setting the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability for all operating systems."}],"product_status":{"known_affected":["org.springframework.boot/spring-boot@vers:maven/>=1.0.0.RELEASE|<=2.2.9.RELEASE"]},"references":[{"summary":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-cm59-pr5q-cw85","url":"https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-cm59-pr5q-cw85"},{"summary":"Cve 2022","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-27772"},{"summary":"CVE Record","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-27772"}],"scores":[{"cvss_v3":{"attackComplexity":"HIGH","attackVector":"LOCAL","availabilityImpact":"HIGH","baseScore":7.8,"baseSeverity":"HIGH","confidentialityImpact":"HIGH","environmentalScore":7.9,"environmentalSeverity":"HIGH","integrityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedAttackComplexity":"HIGH","modifiedAttackVector":"LOCAL","modifiedAvailabilityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedConfidentialityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedIntegrityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedPrivilegesRequired":"LOW","modifiedScope":"CHANGED","modifiedUserInteraction":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"LOW","scope":"CHANGED","temporalScore":7.8,"temporalSeverity":"HIGH","userInteraction":"NONE","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","version":"3.1"},"products":["org.springframework.boot/spring-boot@vers:maven/>=1.0.0.RELEASE|<=2.2.9.RELEASE"]}],"title":"CVE-2022-27772/pkg:maven/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot@1.5.1.RELEASE?type=jar"},{"acknowledgements":[{"organization":"NVD","urls":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1196"]}],"cve":"CVE-2018-1196","cwe":{"id":"59","name":"Improper Link Resolution Before File Access"},"discovery_date":"2018-10-18T18:05:57","ids":[{"system_name":"CVE Record","text":"CVE-2018-1196"},{"system_name":"GitHub Advisory","text":"GHSA-xx65-cc7g-9pfp"}],"notes":[{"category":"description","details":"Vulnerability Description","text":"Moderate severity vulnerability that affects org.springframework.boot:spring-boot"},{"category":"details","details":"Vulnerability Details","text":"# Moderate severity vulnerability that affects org.springframework.boot:spring-boot Spring Boot supports an embedded launch script that can be used to easily run the application as a systemd or init.d linux service.

Stream Cancellation Attack"},{"category":"details","details":"Vulnerability Details","text":"# HTTP/2 Stream Cancellation Attack ## HTTP/2 Rapid reset attack The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from that TCP connection is processed.  Abuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled, but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.   The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2 attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.  The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available network bandwidth.  In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable cost asymmetry between the server and the client.  Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo advisory and their original conent follows.  ## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away, including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward progress.  swift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while constraining malicious actors.  ## Related CVE(s) BIT-apisix-2023-44487, BIT-aspnet-core-2023-44487,

Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application, processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.  ## Related CVE(s) BIT-tomcat-2020-1938,

The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.  These are the prerequisites for the exploit: - JDK 9 or higher - Apache Tomcat as the Servlet container - Packaged as WAR - `spring-webmvc` or `spring-webflux` dependency  ## Patches  - Spring Framework [5.3.18](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.3.18) and [5.2.20](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.2.20.RELEASE) - Spring Boot [2.6.6](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.6.6) and [2.5.12](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.5.12)  ## Workarounds  For those who are unable to upgrade, leaked reports recommend setting `disallowedFields` on `WebDataBinder` through an `@ControllerAdvice`. This works generally, but as a centrally applied workaround fix, may leave some loopholes, in particular if a controller sets `disallowedFields` locally through its own `@InitBinder` method, which overrides the global setting.  To apply the workaround in a more fail-safe way, applications could extend `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` to update the `WebDataBinder` at the end after all other initialization.

Incomplete fix for Apache Log4j vulnerability # Impact  The fix to address [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a remote code execution (RCE) attack.   ## Affected packages Only the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package is directly affected by this vulnerability. The `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api` should be kept at the same version as the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package to ensure compatability if in use.  # Mitigation  Log4j 2.16.0 fixes this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default. This issue can be mitigated in prior releases (< 2.16.0) by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class).  Log4j 2.15.0 restricts JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default. Note that previous mitigations involving configuration such as to set the system property `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` to `true` do NOT mitigate this specific vulnerability."}],"product_status":{"known_affected":["org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core@vers:maven/>=2.0-alpha1|<=2.12.1"]},"references":[{"summary":"Openwall Mailing

Log4j"},{"category":"details","details":"Vulnerability Details","text":"# Remote code injection in Log4j # Summary  Log4j versions prior to 2.16.0 are subject to a remote code execution vulnerability via the ldap JNDI parser. As per [Apache's Log4j security guide](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html): Apache Log4j2 <=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.16.0, this behavior has been disabled by default.  Log4j version 2.15.0 contained an earlier fix for the vulnerability, but that patch did not disable attacker-controlled JNDI lookups in all situations. For more information, see the `Updated advice for version 2.16.0` section of this advisory.  # Impact  Logging untrusted or user controlled data with a vulnerable version of Log4J may result in Remote Code Execution (RCE) against your application. This includes untrusted data included in logged errors such as exception traces, authentication failures, and other unexpected vectors of user controlled input.   # Affected versions  Any Log4J version prior to v2.15.0 is affected to this specific issue.  The v1 branch of Log4J which is considered End Of Life (EOL) is vulnerable to other RCE vectors so the recommendation is to still update to 2.16.0 where possible.  ## Security releases Additional backports of this fix have been made available in versions 2.3.1, 2.12.2, and 2.12.3  ## Affected packages Only the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package is directly affected by this vulnerability. The `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api` should be kept at the same version as the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package to ensure compatability if in use.  # Remediation Advice  ## Updated advice for version 2.16.0  The Apache Logging Services team provided updated mitigation advice upon the release of version 2.16.0, which [disables JNDI by default and completely removes support for message lookups](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.16.0). Even in version 2.15.0, lookups used in layouts to provide specific pieces of context information will still recursively resolve, possibly triggering JNDI lookups. This problem is being tracked as [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046). More information is available on the [GitHub Security Advisory for CVE-2021-45046](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33).  Users who want to avoid attacker-controlled JNDI lookups but cannot upgrade to 2.16.0 must [ensure that no such lookups resolve to attacker-provided data and ensure that the the JndiLookup class is not loaded](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3221).  Please note that Log4J v1 is End Of Life (EOL) and will not receive patches for this issue. Log4J v1 is also vulnerable to other RCE vectors and we recommend you migrate to Log4J 2.16.0 where possible."}],"product_status":{"known_affected":["org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core@vers:maven/>=2.4|<2.12.2"],"known_not_affected":["org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core@2.12.2"]},"references":[{"summary":"Packetstormsecurity

A potential attack would be to generate a self-signed certificate with a subject name that contains special characters, e.g: `CN=Subject*)(objectclass=`. This will be included into the filter and provides the attacker ability to specify additional attributes in the search query.

The exploitation depends on the structure of the target LDAP directory, as well as what kind of errors are exposed to the user.

This only impacts applications running on Java version 6 and lower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users.  ### Vulnerability Details ###  To fix the vulnerability the code was changed to the following:  ```java   @SuppressJava6Requirement(reason = \"Guarded by version check\")   public static File createTempFile(String prefix, String suffix, File directory) throws IOException {     if (javaVersion() >= 7) {       if (directory == null) {         return Files.createTempFile(prefix, suffix).toFile();       }       return Files.createTempFile(directory.toPath(), prefix, suffix).toFile();     }     if (directory == null) {       return File.createTempFile(prefix, suffix);     }     File file = File.createTempFile(prefix, suffix, directory);     // Try to adjust the perms, if this fails there is not much else we can do...     file.setReadable(false, false);     file.setReadable(true, true);     return file;   } ```  Unfortunately, this logic path was left vulnerable:  ```java     if (directory == null) {       return File.createTempFile(prefix, suffix);     } ```  This file is still readable by all local users.  ### Patches ###  Update to 4.1.77.Final  ### Workarounds ###  Specify your own `java.io.tmpdir` when you start the JVM or use `DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)` to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user or update to Java 7 or above.  ### References ###   - [CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/378.html)  - [CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/379.html)   ### For more information ###  If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:  Open an issue in [netty](https://github.com/netty/netty)   ## Related CVE(s) CVE-2021-21290, CVE-2022-24823, GHSA-5mcr-gq6c-3hq2"}],"product_status":{"known_affected":["io.netty/netty-codec-http@vers:maven/>=4.0.0.Alpha1|<=4.1.9.Final"]},"references":[{"summary":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-269q-hmxg-m83q","url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-269q-hmxg-m83q"},{"summary":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-5mcr-gq6c-3hq2","url":"https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-5mcr-gq6c-3hq2"},{"summary":"Cve 2022","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24823"},{"summary":"CVE Record","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24823"},{"summary":"NetApp Advisory ntap-20220616-0004","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220616-0004"},{"summary":"Oracle Advisory cpujul2022","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"}],"scores":[{"cvss_v3":{"attackComplexity":"LOW","attackVector":"LOCAL","availabilityImpact":"NONE","baseScore":5.5,"baseSeverity":"MEDIUM","confidentialityImpact":"HIGH","environmentalScore":5.5,"environmentalSeverity":"MEDIUM","integrityImpact":"NONE","modifiedAttackComplexity":"LOW","modifiedAttackVector":"LOCAL","modifiedAvailabilityImpact":"NONE","modifiedConfidentialityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedIntegrityImpact":"NONE","modifiedPrivilegesRequired":"LOW","modifiedScope":"UNCHANGED","modifiedUserInteraction":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"LOW","scope":"UNCHANGED","temporalScore":5.5,"temporalSeverity":"MEDIUM","userInteraction":"NONE","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","version":"3.1"},"products":["io.netty/netty-codec-http@vers:maven/>=4.0.0.Alpha1|<=4.1.9.Final"]}],"title":"CVE-2021-21290/pkg:maven/io.netty/netty-codec-http@4.0.27.Final?type=jar"},{"acknowledgements":[{"organization":"NVD","urls":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29025"]}],"cve":"CVE-2024-29025","cwe":{"id":"770","name":"Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"},"discovery_date":"2024-03-25T19:40:50","ids":[{"system_name":"CVE Record","text":"CVE-2024-29025"},{"system_name":"GitHub Advisory","text":"GHSA-5jpm-x58v-624v"}],"notes":[{"category":"description","details":"Vulnerability Description","text":"Netty's HttpPostRequestDecoder can OOM"},{"category":"details","details":"Vulnerability Details","text":"# Netty's HttpPostRequestDecoder can OOM ### Summary The `HttpPostRequestDecoder` can be tricked to accumulate data.

While the decoder can store items on the disk if configured so, there are no limits to the number of fields the form can have, an attacher can send a chunked post consisting of many small fields that will be accumulated in the `bodyListHttpData` list. 2. The decoder cumulates bytes in the `undecodedChunk` buffer until it can decode a field, this field can cumulate data without limits  ### PoC  Here is a Netty branch that provides a fix + tests :

When the handler or the channel does not have an idle timeout, it can be used to make a TCP server using the `SniHandler` to allocate 16MB of heap.  ### Details The `SniHandler` class is a handler that waits for the TLS handshake to configure a `SslHandler` according to the indicated server name by the `ClientHello` record. For this matter it allocates a `ByteBuf` using the value defined in the `ClientHello` record.   Normally the value of the packet should be smaller than the handshake packet but there are not checks done here and the way the code is written, it is possible to craft a packet that makes the `SslClientHelloHandler`  1/ allocate a 16MB `ByteBuf` 2/ not fail `decode` method `in` buffer 3/ get out of the loop without an exception  The combination of this without the use of a timeout makes easy to connect to a TCP server and allocate 16MB of heap memory per connection.  ### Impact If the user has no idle timeout handler configured it might be possible for a remote peer to send a client hello packet which lead the server to buffer up to 16MB of data per connection. This could lead to a OutOfMemoryError and so result in a

enabled"},{"category":"details","details":"Vulnerability Details","text":"# jsoup may not sanitize code injection XSS attempts if SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks is enabled jsoup may incorrectly sanitize HTML including `javascript:` URL expressions, which could allow cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks when a reader subsequently clicks that link. If the non-default `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is enabled, HTML including `javascript:` URLs that have been crafted with control characters will not be sanitized. If the site that this HTML is published on does not set a Content Security Policy, an XSS attack is then possible.  ### Impact Sites that accept input HTML from users and use jsoup to sanitize that HTML, may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, if they have enabled `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` and do not set an appropriate Content Security Policy.  ### Patches This issue is patched in jsoup 1.15.3.  Users should upgrade to this version. Additionally, as the unsanitized input may have been persisted, old content should be cleaned again using the updated version.  ### Workarounds To remediate this issue without immediately upgrading:  - disable `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks`, which will rewrite input URLs as absolute URLs - ensure an appropriate [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is defined. (This should be used regardless of upgrading, as a defence-in-depth best practice.)  ### Background and root cause jsoup includes a [Cleaner](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/safety/Cleaner.html) component, which is designed to [sanitize input HTML](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/cleaning-html/safelist-sanitizer) against configurable safe-lists of acceptable tags, attributes, and attribute values.  This includes removing potentially malicious attributes such as `<a href=\"javascript:...\">`, which may enable XSS attacks. It does this by validating URL attributes against allowed URL protocols (e.g. `http`, `https`).  However, an attacker may be able to bypass this check by embedding control characters into the href attribute value. This causes the Java URL class, which is used to resolve relative URLs to absolute URLs before checking the URL's protocol, to treat the URL as a relative URL. It is then resolved into an absolute URL with the configured base URI.  For example, `java script:...` would resolve to `https://example.com/java script:...`.  By default, when using a safe-list that allows `a` tags, jsoup will rewrite any relative URLs (e.g. `/foo/`) to an absolute URL (e.g. `https://example.com/foo/`). Therefore, this attack attempt would be successfully mitigated. However, if the option [SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/safety/Safelist.html#preserveRelativeLinks(boolean)) is enabled (which does not rewrite relative links to absolute), the input is left as-is.  While Java will treat a path like `java script:` as a relative path, as it does not match the allowed characters of a URL spec, browsers may normalize out the control characters, and subsequently evaluate it as a `javascript:` spec inline expression. That disparity then leads to an XSS opportunity.  Sites defining a Content Security Policy that does not allow javascript expressions in link URLs will not be impacted, as the policy will prevent the script's execution.  ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup) * Email the author of jsoup at [jonathan@hedley.net](mailto:jonathan@hedley.net)  ### Credits Thanks to Jens Häderer, who reported this issue, and contributed to its resolution."}],"product_status":{"known_affected":["org.jsoup/jsoup@vers:maven/>=0.0.0|<1.15.3"],"known_not_affected":["org.jsoup/jsoup@1.15.3"]},"references":[{"summary":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369","url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369"},{"summary":"Jsoup Advisory","url":"https://jsoup.org/news/release-1.15.3"},{"summary":"Cve 2022","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36033"},{"summary":"CVE Record","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36033"},{"summary":"NetApp Advisory ntap-20221104-0006","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221104-0006"}],"scores":[{"cvss_v3":{"attackComplexity":"LOW","attackVector":"NETWORK","availabilityImpact":"NONE","baseScore":6.1,"baseSeverity":"MEDIUM","confidentialityImpact":"LOW","environmentalScore":6.1,"environmentalSeverity":"MEDIUM","integrityImpact":"LOW","modifiedAttackComplexity":"LOW","modifiedAttackVector":"NETWORK","modifiedAvailabilityImpact":"NONE","modifiedConfidentialityImpact":"LOW","modifiedIntegrityImpact":"LOW","modifiedPrivilegesRequired":"NONE","modifiedScope":"CHANGED","modifiedUserInteraction":"REQUIRED","privilegesRequired":"NONE","scope":"CHANGED","temporalScore":6.1,"temporalSeverity":"MEDIUM","userInteraction":"REQUIRED","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","version":"3.1"},"products":["org.jsoup/jsoup@vers:maven/>=0.0.0|<1.15.3"]}],"title":"CVE-2022-36033/pkg:maven/org.jsoup/jsoup@1.10.2?type=jar"},{"acknowledgements":[{"organization":"NVD","urls":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37714"]}],"cve":"CVE-2021-37714","cwe":{"id":"248","name":"Uncaught Exception"},"discovery_date":"2021-08-23T19:42:38","ids":[{"system_name":"CVE Record","text":"CVE-2021-37714"},{"system_name":"GitHub Advisory","text":"GHSA-m72m-mhq2-9p6c"},{"system_name":"Oracle Advisory","text":"cpuapr2022"},{"system_name":"Oracle Advisory","text":"cpujan2022"},{"system_name":"Oracle Advisory","text":"cpujul2022"},{"system_name":"NetApp Advisory","text":"ntap-20220210-0022"},{"system_name":"Jsoup Advisory","text":"release-1"}],"notes":[{"audience":"developers","category":"other","text":"Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition","title":"Additional CWE: 835"},{"category":"description","details":"Vulnerability Description","text":"Uncaught Exception in jsoup"},{"category":"details","details":"Vulnerability Details","text":"# Uncaught Exception in jsoup ### Impact _What kind of vulnerability is it?

A `ConstructorException` is thrown, but only after a malicious payload is deserialized.  ### Severity High, lack of type checks during deserialization allows remote code execution.  ### Proof of Concept Execute `bash run.sh`. The PoC uses Constructor to deserialize a payload for RCE. RCE is demonstrated by using a payload which performs a http request to http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Example of vulnerable code: ```java public static class HasTempFolder {   @Rule   public TemporaryFolder folder = new TemporaryFolder();    @Test   public void testUsingTempFolder() throws IOException {     folder.getRoot(); // Previous file permissions: `drwxr-xr-x`; After fix:`drwx------`     File createdFile= folder.newFile(\"myfile.txt\"); // unchanged/irrelevant file permissions     File createdFolder= folder.newFolder(\"subfolder\"); // unchanged/irrelevant file permissions     // ...   } } ```  ### Impact  On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system.  This vulnerability **does not** allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability.  When analyzing the impact of this vulnerability, here are the important questions to ask:  1. Do the JUnit tests write sensitive information, like API keys or passwords, into the temporary folder?   - If yes, this vulnerability impacts you, but only if you also answer 'yes' to question 2.   - If no, this vulnerability does not impact you. 2. Do the JUnit tests ever execute in an environment where the OS has other untrusted users.    _This may apply in CI/CD environments but normally won't be 'yes' for personal developer machines._   - If yes, and you answered 'yes' to question 1, this vulnerability impacts you.   - If no, this vulnerability does not impact you.  ### Patches  Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using.  - Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 4.13.1.  - Java 1.6 and lower users: **no patch is available, you must use the workaround below.**  ### Workarounds  If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability.  ### References - [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized

When reaching a ‘[‘ or ‘{‘ character in the JSON input, the code parses an array or an object respectively. It was discovered that the 3PP does not have any limit to the nesting of such arrays or objects. Since the parsing of nested arrays and objects is done recursively, nesting too many of them can cause stack exhaustion (stack overflow) and crash the software.  ### Patches This vulnerability was fixed in json-smart version 2.4.9, but the maintainer recommends upgrading to 2.4.10, due to a remaining bug.  ### Workarounds N/A  ### References - https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-1370 - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1370 - https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-NETMINIDEV-3369748"}],"product_status":{"known_affected":["net.minidev/json-smart@vers:maven/>=1.0.6.3|<=2.4.8"],"known_not_affected":["net.minidev/json-smart@2.4.10"]},"references":[{"summary":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-493p-pfq6-5258","url":"https://github.com/oswaldobapvicjr/jsonmerge/security/advisories/GHSA-493p-pfq6-5258"},{"summary":"Cve 2023","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1370"},{"summary":"CVE Record","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1370"},{"summary":"Jfrog Advisory stack-exhaustion-in-json-smart-leads-to-denial-of-service-when-parsing-malformed-json-xray-427633","url":"https://research.jfrog.com/vulnerabilities/stack-exhaustion-in-json-smart-leads-to-denial-of-service-when-parsing-malformed-json-xray-427633"},{"summary":"NetApp Advisory ntap-20240621-0006","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006"},{"summary":"Snyk Advisory SNYK-JAVA-NETMINIDEV-3369748","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-NETMINIDEV-3369748"},{"summary":"Cve 2023","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-1370"}],"scores":[{"cvss_v3":{"attackComplexity":"LOW","attackVector":"NETWORK","availabilityImpact":"HIGH","baseScore":7.5,"baseSeverity":"HIGH","confidentialityImpact":"NONE","environmentalScore":7.5,"environmentalSeverity":"HIGH","integrityImpact":"NONE","modifiedAttackComplexity":"LOW","modifiedAttackVector":"NETWORK","modifiedAvailabilityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedConfidentialityImpact":"NONE","modifiedIntegrityImpact":"NONE","modifiedPrivilegesRequired":"NONE","modifiedScope":"UNCHANGED","modifiedUserInteraction":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","temporalScore":7.5,"temporalSeverity":"HIGH","userInteraction":"NONE","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","version":"3.1"},"products":["net.minidev/json-smart@vers:maven/>=1.0.6.3|<=2.4.8"]}],"title":"CVE-2023-1370/pkg:maven/net.minidev/json-smart@2.2.1?type=jar"},{"acknowledgements":[{"organization":"NVD","urls":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27568"]}],"cve":"CVE-2021-27568","cwe":{"id":"754","name":"Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions"},"discovery_date":"2021-06-16T18:03:47","ids":[{"system_name":"CVE Record","text":"CVE-2021-27568"},{"system_name":"Oracle Advisory","text":"cpuapr2022"},{"system_name":"Oracle Advisory","text":"cpujan2022"},{"system_name":"Oracle Advisory","text":"cpujul2021"}],"notes":[{"category":"description","details":"Vulnerability Description","text":"Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions in json-smart"},{"category":"details","details":"Vulnerability Details","text":"# Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions in json-smart An issue was discovered in netplex json-smart-v1 through 2015-10-23 and json-smart-v2 through 2.4.

There is no vulnerability in the driver when using the default query mode. Users that do not override the query mode are not impacted.  # Exploitation  To exploit this behavior the following conditions must be met:  1. A placeholder for a numeric value must be immediately preceded by a minus (i.e. `-`) 1. There must be a second placeholder for a string value after the first placeholder on the same line.  1. Both parameters must be user controlled.  The prior behavior of the driver when operating in simple query mode would inline the negative value of the first parameter and cause the resulting line to be treated as a `--` SQL comment. That would extend to the beginning of the next parameter and cause the quoting of that parameter to be consumed by the comment line. If that string parameter includes a newline, the resulting text would appear unescaped in the resulting SQL.  When operating in the default extended query mode this would not be an issue as the parameter values are sent separately to the server. Only in simple query mode the parameter values are inlined into the executed SQL causing this issue.  # Example  ```java PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(\"SELECT -?, ?\"); stmt.setInt(1, -1); stmt.setString(2, \" WHERE false --\"); ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(); ```  The resulting SQL when operating in simple query mode would be:  ```sql SELECT --1,' WHERE false --' ```  The contents of the second parameter get injected into the command. Note how both the number of result columns and the WHERE clause of the command have changed. A more elaborate example could execute arbitrary other SQL commands.  # Patch Problem will be patched upgrade to 42.7.2, 42.6.1, 42.5.5, 42.4.4, 42.3.9, 42.2.28, 42.2.28.jre7  The patch fixes the inlining of parameters by forcing them all to be serialized as wrapped literals. The SQL in the prior example would be transformed into:  ```sql SELECT -('-1'::int4), (' WHERE false --') ```  # Workarounds Do not use the connection property`preferQueryMode=simple`. (*NOTE: If you do not explicitly specify a query mode then you are using the default of `extended` and are not impacted by this issue.*)  ## Related CVE(s) BIT-postgresql-jdbc-driver-2024-1597, CVE-2024-1597, CVE-2024-32888, GHSA-x3wm-hffr-chwm"}],"product_status":{"known_affected":["org.postgresql/postgresql@vers:maven/>=42.3.0|<42.3.9"],"known_not_affected":["org.postgresql/postgresql@42.3.9"]},"references":[{"summary":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-24rp-q3w6-vc56","url":"https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-24rp-q3w6-vc56"},{"summary":"Cve 2024","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1597"},{"summary":"CVE Record","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1597"}],"scores":[{"cvss_v3":{"attackComplexity":"LOW","attackVector":"NETWORK","availabilityImpact":"HIGH","baseScore":10.0,"baseSeverity":"CRITICAL","confidentialityImpact":"HIGH","environmentalScore":10.0,"environmentalSeverity":"CRITICAL","integrityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedAttackComplexity":"LOW","modifiedAttackVector":"NETWORK","modifiedAvailabilityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedConfidentialityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedIntegrityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedPrivilegesRequired":"NONE","modifiedScope":"CHANGED","modifiedUserInteraction":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"NONE","scope":"CHANGED","temporalScore":10.0,"temporalSeverity":"CRITICAL","userInteraction":"NONE","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","version":"3.1"},"products":["org.postgresql/postgresql@vers:maven/>=42.3.0|<42.3.9"]}],"title":"CVE-2024-1597/pkg:maven/org.postgresql/postgresql@42.3.1?type=jar"},{"acknowledgements":[{"organization":"NVD","urls":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41946"]}],"cve":"CVE-2022-41946","cwe":{"id":"200","name":"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"},"discovery_date":"2022-11-23T22:17:25","ids":[{"system_name":"CVE Record","text":"CVE-2022-41946"},{"system_name":"GitHub Advisory","text":"GHSA-562r-vg33-8x8h"},{"system_name":"NetApp Advisory","text":"ntap-20240329-0003"}],"notes":[{"audience":"developers","category":"other","text":"Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere","title":"Additional CWE: 668"},{"category":"description","details":"Vulnerability Description","text":"TemporaryFolder on unix-like systems does not limit access to created files"},{"category":"details","details":"Vulnerability Details","text":"# TemporaryFolder on unix-like systems does not limit access to created files **Vulnerability**  `PreparedStatement.setText(int, InputStream)` and  `PreparedStatemet.setBytea(int, InputStream)`  will create a temporary file if the InputStream is larger than 51k    Example of vulnerable code:  ```java String s = \"some very large string greater than 51200 bytes\";  PreparedStatement.setInputStream(1, new ByteArrayInputStream(s.getBytes()) ); ``` This will create a temporary file which is readable by other users on Unix like systems, but not MacOS.  Impact On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system.  This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability.  When analyzing the impact of this vulnerability, here are the important questions to ask:  Is the driver running in an environment where the OS has other untrusted users. If yes, and you answered 'yes' to question 1, this vulnerability impacts you. If no, this vulnerability does not impact you. Patches Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using.  Java 1.8 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 42.2.27, 42.3.8, 42.4.3, 42.5.1 Java 1.7 users: this vulnerability is fixed in 42.2.27.jre7 Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available; you must use the workaround below. Workarounds If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the java.io.tmpdir system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability.

That's not specific to the pgjdbc driver either, it would be true for any library that can write to the application's local file system.  While we do not consider this a security issue with the driver, we have decided to remove the loggerFile and loggerLevel connection properties in the next release of the driver. Removal of those properties does not make exposing the JDBC URL or connection properties to an attacker safe and we continue to suggest that applications do not allow untrusted users to specify arbitrary connection properties. We are removing them to prevent misuse and their functionality can be delegated to java.util.logging.  If you identify an application that allows remote users to specify a complete JDBC URL or properties without validating it's contents, we encourage you to notify the application owner as that may be a security defect in that specific application.  ### Impact It is possible to specify an arbitrary filename in the loggerFileName connection parameter \"jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/test?user=test&password=test&loggerLevel=DEBUG&loggerFile=./blah.jsp&<%Runtime.getRuntime().exec(request.getParameter(\\\"i\\\"));%>\"  This creates a valid JSP file which could lead to a Remote Code Execution   ### Patches LoggerFile implementation has been removed and will be ignored by the driver, fixed in 42.3.3  ### Workarounds sanitize the inputs to the driver  Reported by Allan Lou v3ged0ge@gmail.com"}],"product_status":{"known_affected":["org.postgresql/postgresql@vers:maven/>=42.1.0|<42.3.3"],"known_not_affected":["org.postgresql/postgresql@42.3.3"]},"references":[{"summary":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-673j-qm5f-xpv8","url":"https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-673j-qm5f-xpv8"}],"scores":[{"cvss_v3":{"attackComplexity":"HIGH","attackVector":"NETWORK","availabilityImpact":"LOW","baseScore":5.0,"baseSeverity":"MEDIUM","confidentialityImpact":"LOW","environmentalScore":5.0,"environmentalSeverity":"MEDIUM","integrityImpact":"LOW","modifiedAttackComplexity":"HIGH","modifiedAttackVector":"NETWORK","modifiedAvailabilityImpact":"LOW","modifiedConfidentialityImpact":"LOW","modifiedIntegrityImpact":"LOW","modifiedPrivilegesRequired":"NONE","modifiedScope":"UNCHANGED","modifiedUserInteraction":"REQUIRED","privilegesRequired":"NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","temporalScore":5.0,"temporalSeverity":"MEDIUM","userInteraction":"REQUIRED","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","version":"3.1"},"products":["org.postgresql/postgresql@vers:maven/>=42.1.0|<42.3.3"]}],"title":"GHSA-673j-qm5f-xpv8/pkg:maven/org.postgresql/postgresql@42.3.1?type=jar"},{"acknowledgements":[{"organization":"NVD","urls":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26520"]}],"cve":"CVE-2022-26520","discovery_date":"2022-03-11T00:02:02","ids":[{"system_name":"CVE Record","text":"CVE-2022-26520"},{"system_name":"GitHub Advisory","text":"GHSA-673j-qm5f-xpv8"},{"system_name":"Postgresql Advisory","text":"changelog"},{"system_name":"Debian Advisory","text":"dsa-5196"},{"system_name":"Postgresql Advisory","text":"tomcat"}],"notes":[{"category":"description","details":"Vulnerability Description","text":"Path traversal in org.postgresql:postgresql"},{"category":"details","details":"Vulnerability Details","text":"# Path traversal in org.postgresql:postgresql In pgjdbc before 42.3.3, an attacker (who controls the jdbc URL or properties) can call java.util.logging.FileHandler to write to arbitrary files through the loggerFile and loggerLevel connection properties.

Who is impacted?_  The PGJDBC implementation of the `java.sql.ResultRow.refreshRow()` method is not performing escaping of column names so a malicious column name that contains a statement terminator, e.g. `;`, could lead to SQL injection. This could lead to executing additional SQL commands as the application's JDBC user.  User applications that do not invoke the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method are not impacted.  User application that do invoke that method are impacted if the underlying database that they are querying via their JDBC application may be under the control of an attacker. The attack requires the attacker to trick the user into executing SQL against a table name who's column names would contain the malicious SQL and subsequently invoke the `refreshRow()` method on the ResultSet.  For example:  ```sql CREATE TABLE refresh_row_example (  id   int PRIMARY KEY,  \"1 FROM refresh_row_example; SELECT pg_sleep(10); SELECT * \" int ); ```  This example has a table with two columns. The name of the second column is crafted to contain a statement terminator followed by additional SQL. Invoking the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` on a ResultSet that queried this table, e.g. `SELECT * FROM refresh_row`, would cause the additional SQL commands such as the `SELECT pg_sleep(10)` invocation to be executed.  As the multi statement command would contain multiple results, it would not be possible for the attacker to get data directly out of this approach as the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method would throw an exception. However, the attacker could execute any arbitrary SQL including inserting the data into another table that could then be read or any other DML / DDL statement.  Note that the application's JDBC user and the schema owner need not be the same. A JDBC application that executes as a privileged user querying database schemas owned by potentially malicious less-privileged users would be vulnerable. In that situation it may be possible for the malicious user to craft a schema that causes the application to execute commands as the privileged user.  ### Patches _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_  Yes, versions 42.2.26, 42.3.7, and 42.4.1 have been released with a fix.  ### Workarounds _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_  Check that you are not using the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method.  If you are, ensure that the code that executes that method does not connect to a database that is controlled by an unauthenticated or malicious user. If your application only connects to its own database with a fixed schema with no DDL permissions, then you will not be affected by this vulnerability as it requires a maliciously crafted schema.   ## Related CVE(s) BIT-postgresql-jdbc-driver-2022-31197, CVE-2022-31197"}],"product_status":{"known_affected":["org.postgresql/postgresql@vers:maven/>=42.3.0|<42.3.7"],"known_not_affected":["org.postgresql/postgresql@42.3.7"]},"references":[{"summary":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-r38f-c4h4-hqq2","url":"https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-r38f-c4h4-hqq2"},{"summary":"Debian Mailing List Announcement","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00009.html"},{"summary":"Fedora Project Mailing List Announcement","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/I6WHUADTZBBQLVHO4YG4XCWDGWBT4LRP"},{"summary":"Fedora Project Mailing List Announcement","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UTFE6SV33P5YYU2GNTQZQKQRVR3GYE4S"},{"summary":"Cve 2022","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31197"},{"summary":"CVE Record","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31197"}],"scores":[{"cvss_v3":{"attackComplexity":"HIGH","attackVector":"NETWORK","availabilityImpact":"HIGH","baseScore":7.1,"baseSeverity":"HIGH","confidentialityImpact":"HIGH","environmentalScore":7.1,"environmentalSeverity":"HIGH","integrityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedAttackComplexity":"HIGH","modifiedAttackVector":"NETWORK","modifiedAvailabilityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedConfidentialityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedIntegrityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedPrivilegesRequired":"LOW","modifiedScope":"UNCHANGED","modifiedUserInteraction":"REQUIRED","privilegesRequired":"LOW","scope":"UNCHANGED","temporalScore":7.1,"temporalSeverity":"HIGH","userInteraction":"REQUIRED","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","version":"3.1"},"products":["org.postgresql/postgresql@vers:maven/>=42.3.0|<42.3.7"]}],"title":"CVE-2022-31197/pkg:maven/org.postgresql/postgresql@42.3.1?type=jar"},{"acknowledgements":[{"organization":"NVD","urls":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21724"]}],"cve":"CVE-2022-21724","cwe":{"id":"665","name":"Improper Initialization"},"discovery_date":"2022-02-02T00:04:20","ids":[{"system_name":"CVE Record","text":"CVE-2022-21724"},{"system_name":"GitHub Advisory","text":"GHSA-v7wg-cpwc-24m4"},{"system_name":"Debian Advisory","text":"dsa-5196"},{"system_name":"NetApp Advisory","text":"ntap-20220311-0005"}],"notes":[{"audience":"developers","category":"other","text":"Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere","title":"Additional CWE: 668"},{"audience":"developers","category":"other","text":"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component","title":"Additional CWE: 74"},{"category":"description","details":"Vulnerability Description","text":"pgjdbc Does Not Check Class Instantiation when providing Plugin Classes"},{"category":"details","details":"Vulnerability Details","text":"# pgjdbc Does Not Check Class Instantiation when providing Plugin Classes ### Impact  pgjdbc instantiates plugin instances based on class names provided via `authenticationPluginClassName`, `sslhostnameverifier`, `socketFactory`, `sslfactory`, `sslpasswordcallback` connection properties.

H2 Console doesn't accept remote connections by default. If remote access was enabled explicitly and some protection method (such as security constraint) wasn't set, an intruder can load own custom class and execute its code in a process with H2 Console (H2 Server process or a web server with H2 Console servlet).  It is also possible to load them by creation a linked table in these versions, but it requires `ADMIN` privileges and user with `ADMIN` privileges has full access to the Java process by design. These privileges should never be granted to untrusted users.  ### Patches Since version 2.0.206 H2 Console and linked tables explicitly forbid attempts to specify LDAP URLs for JNDI. Only local data sources can be used.  ### Workarounds H2 Console should never be available to untrusted users.  `-webAllowOthers` is a dangerous setting that should be avoided.  H2 Console Servlet deployed on a web server can be protected with a security constraint: https://h2database.com/html/tutorial.html#usingH2ConsoleServlet If `webAllowOthers` is specified, you need to uncomment and edit `<security-role>` and `<security-constraint>` as necessary. See documentation of your web server for more details.  ### References This issue was found and privately reported to H2 team by [JFrog Security](https://www.jfrog.com/)'s vulnerability research team with detailed information."}],"product_status":{"known_affected":["com.h2database/h2@vers:maven/>=1.1.100|<2.0.206"],"known_not_affected":["com.h2database/h2@2.0.206"]},"references":[{"summary":"GitHub Advisory GHSA-h376-j262-vhq6","url":"https://github.com/h2database/h2database/security/advisories/GHSA-h376-j262-vhq6"},{"summary":"Jfrog Advisory the-jndi-strikes-back-unauthenticated-rce-in-h2-database-console","url":"https://jfrog.com/blog/the-jndi-strikes-back-unauthenticated-rce-in-h2-database-console"},{"summary":"Debian Mailing List Announcement","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/02/msg00017.html"},{"summary":"Cve 2021","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42392"},{"summary":"CVE Record","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42392"},{"summary":"NetApp Advisory ntap-20220119-0001","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220119-0001"},{"summary":"Debian Advisory dsa-5076","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5076"},{"summary":"Oracle Advisory cpuapr2022","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"},{"summary":"Secpod Advisory log4shell-critical-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-in-h2database-console","url":"https://www.secpod.com/blog/log4shell-critical-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-in-h2database-console"}],"scores":[{"cvss_v3":{"attackComplexity":"LOW","attackVector":"NETWORK","availabilityImpact":"HIGH","baseScore":9.8,"baseSeverity":"CRITICAL","confidentialityImpact":"HIGH","environmentalScore":9.8,"environmentalSeverity":"CRITICAL","integrityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedAttackComplexity":"LOW","modifiedAttackVector":"NETWORK","modifiedAvailabilityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedConfidentialityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedIntegrityImpact":"HIGH","modifiedPrivilegesRequired":"NONE","modifiedScope":"UNCHANGED","modifiedUserInteraction":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","temporalScore":9.8,"temporalSeverity":"CRITICAL","userInteraction":"NONE","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","version":"3.1"},"products":["com.h2database/h2@vers:maven/>=1.1.100|<2.0.206"]}],"title":"CVE-2021-42392/pkg:maven/com.h2database/h2@1.4.199?type=jar"}]}
